### Sprint #10 - Linear Algebra

**Description:** You need to protect the customer data of the insurance company "Even a flood". Develop a method of data transformation so that it is difficult to recover personal information from them. Justify the correctness of his work. It is necessary to protect the data so that the quality of machine learning models does not deteriorate during the conversion. There is no need to select the best model. Follow these steps to develop a new algorithm:

* construct a theoretical proof using properties of models and the given task;
* formulate an algorithm for this proof;
* check that the algorithm is working correctly when applied to real data.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Sklearn`

### Sprint #9 - Integrated project 2

**Description:** The goal of the project is to prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for an industrial enterprise, which will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. At the disposal of the data with the parameters of extraction and purification.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Sklearn`, `CatBoost`

### Sprint #8 - Machine Learning for Business

**Description:** The oil company needs to decide where to drill a new well. Oil samples are available in three regions: in each 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. The goal is to build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. Analyze possible profits and risks with the Bootstrap technique.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Sklearn`

### Sprint #7 - Supervised learning

**Description:** The bank faced a problem - customers began to leave. Marketers have decided that it is cheaper to retain current customers than to attract new ones. The goal is to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. It is necessary to build a model with a sufficient value of F1-measure (at least 0.59), and for the constructed model to measure AUC-ROC, and compare its value with F1-measure. Historical data on customer behavior and termination of contracts with the bank are available.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Sklearn`, `Imblearn`

### Sprint #6 - Introduction to machine learning

**Description:** The mobile operator wants to build a system capable of analyzing customer behavior and offering a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra". The goal is to build a model for the classification problem with the highest accuracy value, which will choose the appropriate tariff.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Sklearn`

### Sprint #5 - Integrated Project 1

**Description:** Historical data on computer game store sales are available from open sources: user and expert ratings, genres and platforms. The goal is to identify patterns that determine the success of the game, which will help promote a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `SciPy`

### Sprint #4 - Statistical data analysis

**Description:** The mobile operator offers customers two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the operator needs to understand which tariff brings more money. The goal is to analyze the behavior of customers and make a conclusion - which tariff is better. To do this, a preliminary analysis of tariffs was carried out on a small sample of customers. The data of 500 users of the operator is available: who they are, from where, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `SciPy` 

### Sprint #3 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Description:** You have the data of the Yandex Real Estate service — an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your task is to set the parameters. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

### Sprint #2 - Data Preprocessing

**Description:** The customer is the loan division of the bank. It is necessary to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank — statistics on the solvency of customers. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model — a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`
