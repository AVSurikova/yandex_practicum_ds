## Sprint #10 - Linear Algebra

The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to protect its clients' data. Your task is to develop a data transforming algorithm that would make it hard to recover personal information from the transformed data. This is called data masking, or data obfuscation. You are also expected to prove that the algorithm works correctly. Additionally, the data should be protected in such a way that the quality of machine learning models doesn't suffer. You don't need to pick the best model. Follow these steps to develop a new algorithm:

construct a theoretical proof using properties of models and the given task;
formulate an algorithm for this proof;
check that the algorithm is working correctly when applied to real data.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Sklearn`

## Sprint #9 - Integrated project 2

Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters. You need to:

Prepare the data;
Perform data analysis;
Develop and train a model. To complete the project, you may want to use documentation from pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn. The next lesson is about the ore purification process. You will pick the information that is important for the model development.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Sklearn`, `CatBoost`

## Sprint #8 - Machine Learning for Business

You work for the OilyGiant mining company. Your task is to find the best place for a new well. Steps to choose the location: Collect the oil well parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves; Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells; Pick the oil wells with the highest estimated values; Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells. You have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Sklearn`

## Sprint #7 - Supervised learning

Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones. We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. To pass the project, you need an F1 score of at least 0.59. Check the F1 for the test set. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Sklearn`, `Imblearn`

## Sprint #6 - Introduction to machine learning

Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. You have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis course). For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right plan. Since you’ve already performed the data preprocessing step, you can move straight to creating the model. Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Sklearn`

## Sprint #5 - Integrated Project 1

Historical data on computer game store sales are available from open sources: user and expert ratings, genres and platforms. The goal is to identify patterns that determine the success of the game, which will help promote a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `SciPy`

## Sprint #4 - Statistical data analysis

The mobile operator offers customers two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the operator needs to understand which tariff brings more money. The goal is to analyze the behavior of customers and make a conclusion - which tariff is better. To do this, a preliminary analysis of tariffs was carried out on a small sample of customers. The data of 500 users of the operator is available: who they are, from where, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly, `SciPy`

## Sprint #3 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

You have the data of the Yandex Real Estate service — an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your task is to set the parameters. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

## Sprint #2 - Data Preprocessing

**Description:** The customer is the loan division of the bank. It is necessary to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank — statistics on the solvency of customers. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model — a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.

**Stack:** `Python`, `Pandas`
